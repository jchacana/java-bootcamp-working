# Evolving your ATM simulation

Up to this point, we have learned a new technology to organize our project, as well as some standard frameworks like JPA (and ORM) or Spring.

For this stage, the requirements are:

  - Migrate your current project to a maven structure. Don't move forward unless you've solved this point. Remember to commit your changes and keep everything in the same repository. We need to know when this migration was done.
  - Add JPA support to your project. Achieve this by adding the correct maven dependency
  - Now with JPA support, modify your model so you can map entities with tables
  - Create either a physical database or an in-memory sql database. It's up to you
  - Add support for JUnit
    - Add at least 5 unit tests

Remember to still support previous requirements. We're evolving an application
