# Evolving your ATM simulation

We were using a fixed set of accounts and keeping them into memory. As we're evolving our app, we'll need to adjust it for a few requirements

  - Read the account initial info from a csv file
    - Fields will remain ` Name `, ` PIN `, ` Balance `, ` Account Number `
  - CSV file needs to have at least 20 records. Be creative :-)
  - In order to read from CSV file, apply everything you've learned so far in this unit.
  - We can safely assume that the CSV file will be on your disk, so you can pass an absolute path to read it
  - Pass the file location as a program argument
  - Add the following validations:
    - There can't be 2 different accounts with the same Account Number {{number}} (use this as a message)
    - There can't be duplicated records {{record}}(use this as a message and show the whole record)
    - When any of this exceptions happens show the corresponding message on screen
    
  - We need to keep track of the transactions that have been made in our system. For that reason, model something that will help us with this requirement
  - Provide a screen that help us query the last 10 transactions of a given account
  - Use class/objects/methods names according to the DOMAIN. REFACTOR IF NECESSARY

# HINT!
You can make use of everything you've learned to this point. Special attention to Lambdas, Streams and I/O

# Review

Each person will randomly review at least two of other person’s work.

Follow the steps below:

 - Run the application. Is the Welcome screen displayed?
 - Does the application provide all the previous functionalities?
 - Does the application provide the functionality to read a file from program arguments? (i.e. passing an absolute path)
 - Does the app allow to transfer to any of the accounts loaded from the file?
 - Does the app provide a way of reading a csv record into an account? How cluttered is the code?
 - Are there at least 3 abstractions?
   - Expected here would be to have:
     - Account class representation
     - Transaction class representation (along with some children like Withdraw, Transfer, Inquiry or anything that allows us to classify them)
     - Repository for reading from CSV file. A "pseudo"-DAO would be enough
     - Other domain classes are ok
 - Does the code show any way of validating uniqueness of an account
 - Does the app provide a way of querying last X transactions
 - Does the app implement a way of reading the CSV file via Streams and I/O?








SIDE NOTE:
- I think the concurrency part will be a bit difficult to simulate or implement at this moment. Also, nowadays is very unlikely that someone will ever need to implement concurrency on a low-level. 
For example, Spring Boot provides already a ThreadPoolExecutor easily configurable for async tasks. Also, streams api provide tthe parallelStream method to allow the app process the operations in parallel. I think the concurrency could be evaluated on the Green Belt level
